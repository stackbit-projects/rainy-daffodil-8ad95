      - title: Henna Club
        content: >+
          (August 2021 - present)


          Being in Canada has taught me just how privileged I am. I have access
          to good education, clean water, and I have exposure to a wide range of
          cultures from around the world. But, while discovering the different
          traditions that many have to offer, it is very easy to lose one's own
          culture.  As I spend more time living in Canada, I can slowly feel
          myself stray away from my roots and culture. To fix that, I decided to
          enroll in a Henna club. This club teaches me how to perfect the art of
          Henna, it enables me to learn more about my culture, and I get to
          share it with others around me.

          (January 2021 - present)


          Back in January, I decided that I wanted to try out a new sport. I had
          a bit of free time on my hands, and I figured there was no better way
          to spend it than by trying new things. One day, while browsing online,
          I came across a stable that offered horseback riding lessons to
          individuals of all ages. I had never been on a horse before, and it
          was a completely new experience for me. I decided to give it a shot,
          and I instantly loved it. Currently, I go riding once every week for
          about 30-40 minutes.

          I started badminton when I was in Grade 9. My curiosity in the sport
          started with me accompanying my elder sister to practice. Every
          Saturday, I would watch her play for 2 hours while my mother would go
          on to finish her weekly grocery shopping. After a couple of weeks of
          watching my sister play, my curiosity in badminton peaked, and
          eventually, when I was old enough, my mother enrolled me as well in
          the KW-Badminton Club.

          (October 2021 - present)


          After having taken Computer Science courses in both Grade 10 and Grade
          11, I decided that I wanted to challenge myself and take my CS skills
          to the next level. So, I went ahead and enrolled myself in a
          first-year Computer Science course that is offered by Harvard
          University. This online course runs for 12 weeks, and it has helped me
          greatly expand my knowledge in programming. Although it has been tough
          to do this course while doing in my Grade 12 courses, I have been
          managing my time efficiently, and I am proud to say that I will be
          receiving a certificate in the course by the end of December.

      - title: Swimming

          (January 2017 - January 2021)


          Swimming is something that I have always found pleasure doing. It not
          only provides you with good exercise, but it can also be a stress
          reliever. Over the years, I have been enrolled in multiple swimming
          classes, levelling up after each term. It was something that I always
          looked forward to since it was very amusing. Unfortunately, as I was
          about to start a lifeguarding class, Covid arrived, and I had to stop
          swimming entirely. I have not gone back due to how the rise in Covid
          cases, but once everything clears up, I cannot wait to get back in the
          water.

      - title: University of Waterloo's Technova Hackathon
        content: >
          (24th August 2021 - 29th August 2021)




          In the past, I have done both the Pascal and Cayley math contest that
          was hosted by the University of Waterloo. Apart from those, I haven't
          participated in any other activities that the University hosts.
          However, this all changed when I came across the University of
          Waterloo's very first Global Women in Tech+ Hackathon. When I saw the
          ad about the Hackathon, I immediately sent out my application, and I
          was ecstatic when I learned that I got accepted. This event was very
          enjoyable, and it allowed me to network with individuals from all over
          the world, as well as with representatives from companies such as
          Amazon, Microsoft, D2L, and many more. The TechNova Hackathon opened
          my eyes to how fun the University of Waterloo can be and how many
          opportunities await for me once I am able to attend there.

          (September 2018 - January 2021)


          With being fluent in English, French, and Creole, I was able to land a
          part-time babysitting job at a french-speaking home. I would babysit
          three kids at a time, once or twice during the school week, for an
          estimate of 5 hours.  This job taught me how to manage my time well
          since I would often be doing my school work while also looking after
          the kids. It taught me how to do multiple tasks at once, and I believe
          that it helped me learn many skills that will come in clutch in
          University. The children that I previously babysat no longer need to
          be looked after, but whenever I am occasionally needed at other
          places, I still go and take care of little kids.
