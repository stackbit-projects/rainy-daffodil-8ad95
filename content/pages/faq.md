      - title: Horseback Riding

          (January 2021 - present)


          Back in January, I decided that I wanted to try out a new sport. I had
          a bit of free time on my hands, and I figured there was no better way
          to spend it than by trying new things. One day, while browsing online,
          I came across a stable that offered horseback riding lessons to
          individuals of all ages. I had never been on a horse before, and it
          was a completely new experience for me. I decided to give it a shot,
          and I instantly loved it. Currently, I go riding once every week for
          about 30-40 minutes.

          I started badminton when I was in Grade 9. My curiosity in the sport
          started with me accompanying my elder sister to practice. Every
          Saturday, I would watch her play for 2 hours while my mother would go
          on to finish her weekly grocery shopping. After a couple of weeks of
          watching my sister play, my curiosity in badminton peaked, and
          eventually, when I was old enough, my mother enrolled me as well in
          KW-Badminton Club.

          Depending on the scope and timeline of your content needs, we can work
          on a retainer basis, an hour bank, or a per-project basis. Once I
          understand your needs I will create a tailored proposal with several
          options to choose from.

          No product or service is too technical to learn and understand. Part
          of our initial onboarding is an in-depth understanding of your
          offerings, your target audience and your level of technical writing
          needed

          The onboarding process typically lasts 3-4 days and consists of an
          intro video call, an interview, a questionnaire and some back and
          forth communication for technical purposes. After that, we can go as
          fast as you need.

          You can choose to provide the design yourself, or I can include a
          design element to your proposal. I work with several wonderful
          designers with ample experience in web, digital, campaign and
          marketing design.
