"Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."  - Steve Jobs

This one quote is something that has always been on my mind ever since I heard it. It taught me that you always need to believe and trust yourself, even if it means taking risks because, without it, you never know what you might miss. This was what led me to follow my heart and begin my journey into Computer Science. 

My name is Malvika Dusowoth, and I am a current Grade 12 student at Bluevale Collegiate Institute. My major passions are Computer Science, Maths, and Dance.  Many people tend to talk about how they were born in the wrong era, but to be honest, I couldn't be more grateful to be living in a world where technology is constantly evolving and changing at such a rapid pace. My interest in Computers was first sparked when I was as young as seven years old. My parents had allowed me to use the family computer for the very first time, and ever since that day, I have been hooked. Whether it was to play games or to watch videos, I never let down any opportunity to be around our PC. However, it wasn't until sixth grade that I knew I truly wanted to study Computer Science. During that time, I vividly remember getting my very own laptop for doing well in school. It was like a dream come true. Unfortunately, a couple of months later my headphone jack got stuck inside of my audio port, and I could no longer hear any audio from the computer. Needless to say, I was incredibly disappointed in myself. But, I didn't let that stop me from figuring out what was wrong with my laptop. So, I went to my kitchen drawer, took out a screwdriver, and removed the base of my laptop. I inspected my motherboard and saw the stuck piece of the headphone jack. By some miracle, I was able to remove the part that got stuck, and my audio started to work again. When I had told my family about what happened, they all thought that I was the next Einstein for Computers, since I was so young and had absolutely no prior knowledge of computer hardware. They encouraged me to start thinking about Computer Science as a career path, and here I am 6 years later applying to Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.
