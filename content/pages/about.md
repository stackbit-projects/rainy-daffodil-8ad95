"Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."  - Steve Jobs

This one quote is something that has always been on my mind ever since I heard it. It taught me that you always need to believe and trust yourself, even if it means taking risks because, without it, you never know what you might miss. This was the catalyst that led me to follow my heart and begin my journey into Computer Science.

My name is Malvika Dusowoth, and I am currently a Grade 12 student at Bluevale Collegiate Institute. My major passions are Computer Science, Math, and Dance. Many people tend to talk about how they were born in the wrong era, but to be honest, I couldn't be more grateful to be living in a world where technology is constantly evolving and changing at such a rapid pace. My interest in Computers was first sparked when I was as young as seven years old. My parents had allowed me to use the family computer for the very first time, and ever since that day, I have been hooked. Whether it was to play games or watch videos, I never let down any opportunity to be around our PC. However, it wasn't until sixth grade that I knew I truly wanted to study Computer Science. During that time, I vividly remember getting my very own laptop for doing well in school. It was like a dream come true. Unfortunately, a couple of months later, my headphone jack got stuck inside my audio port, and I could no longer hear any audio from the computer. Needless to say, I was incredibly disappointed in myself. But, I didn't let that stop me from figuring out what was wrong with my laptop. So, I went to my kitchen drawer, took out a screwdriver, and removed the base of my laptop. I inspected my motherboard and saw the stuck piece of the headphone jack. By some miracle, I was able to manually remove the component that had been trapped, and my audio began to function again. At that very moment, I realized just how fascinating computers were and that I wanted to further explore that field of study. My family encouraged me to start thinking about Computer Science as a career path, and here I am 6 years later applying to Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.

To be able to enroll in a course that not only interests you but also enables you to explore your creative side is something that I have always wanted. When I took my very first Technology course in Grade 9, I was absolutely blown away. I learned how to use Photoshop and many more websites that were mainly for graphic designs. I then decided to take a Grade 10 CS course. That was truly one of the best decisions that I could have made in high school. I learned how to use Scratch, HTML, and Python. In Grade 11, I took the University-Level Computer Science course, and I learned how to code JavaScript. However, in Grade 12, I decided that I wanted to further expand my knowledge in Computer Science by challenging my skills. I enrolled myself in a Harvard First-Year CS50 online course, where I am currently in the process of completing the course and earning my certificate in it. This 11-week long course focuses on CSS, C, Data Structure, Algorithms, SQL, Python, JavaScript, Web Development, and many more. Taking this course while also being in my last year of high school has definitely been tough, but if something doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you.
